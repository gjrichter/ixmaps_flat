A group of people were arrested in connection with the vandalism of a school, which appeared to be part of a right-wing extremist plan aimed at inflicting as much economic damage on society as possible through extensive and systematic sabotage. During a house search, a publication called Revolution i välfärdsstaten [Revolution in the welfare state] was found in which the plan was described. The planned actions had been divided into a number of phases. Initially, easily accessible targets such as nearby schools and hospitals would be attacked. The struggle would then escalate to include symbolic buildings, where the Riksdag, the Government Offices and community infrastructure, such as power plants and power plants, were some of the goals. The action would culminate in an assassination attempt with suicide bombers. In early 2005, four of those involved were charged with preparation for terrorist offenses under the new terrorist legislation. However, the preparation could not be proven and the accused were convicted of grievous bodily harm.;5;5;3

Although the autopsy could not establish a direct link between the attack and cause of death with a 100% certainty, medical personnell emphasized that in 90% of the cases, this kind of embolism seems to be caused by physical trauma such as this case.

He was apparently planning to announce his plans live at the Flemish state television before targeting political institutions. He was also suspected of plotting attacks against 'certain people' on November 15, King's Feast Day [Belgian holiday in honour of the country's royal family]. It was therefore speculated that Belgian royals could have been intended targets. He had allegedly attempted to recruit others in the pub. It was reported that “a mental problem plays a role”, without further details. Prosecutors said the threat of attack appears to have been “very concrete, serious and giving rise to concern.” The perpetrator had written a 80-page manifesto, leading local news media to draw comparisons to the 22 July terrorist and some media even called the suspect “the Dutch Breivik.” In the manifesto, the suspect had called for the overthrow of the Belgian state, which he reportedly denounced as an American puppet regime, and for the creation an independent Flemish Republic. There was also a reference to a phrase interpreted as criticism of the American bugging scandal in Europe.;3;2;2

The MP concluded that the incident began with an arbitrary and violent arrest of a young man. Despite not resisting arrest, he was subject to racial slurs, and beaten violently. During the arrest, the victim was pushed against a wall, subjected to racist abuse, and beaten until he fell to the ground bleeding from his mouth and nose. As a result, six others went to inquire about the victim's arrest status. Unprovoked, the MP found that police brutally attacked the six individuals, used a number of racial slurs, and dragged them to the station. The attack included physical beatings and kicks to their heads, as well as the individuals being shot with rubber bullets. One police officer was reported to have said, ""They're all going to die, you f****** blacks."" Another said ""You're going to disappear, you, your race and your shitty neighborhood.

In some cases, the boats were towed back to Turkish waters.

The perpetrator then stabbed a 15-year-old male Somali student in the the abdomen who later died in the hospital. When a 42-year-old teacher asked him to remove his mask, he was stabbed him as well. The victim died due to his injuries six weeks later at the hospital on 3 December. The perpetrator was shot by police and died in the hospital. It was Sweden's first deadly attack on a school in over 50 years. The initial police investigation concluded that the perpetrator was motivated by racism and had chosen the school as his target due to its location in a neighbourhood with a high immigrant population. On the morning of 23 October, Swedish police and media confirmed that the attack had ""racist motives"" and that it was a ""hate crime"". The city's police chief stated that all of the victims were ""dark-skinned"" and head of investigation said that CCTV footage showed that the perpetrator spared the lives of students with white skin. The perpetrator had visited right-wing extremist groups at social media sites supporting Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany and  joined a group on Facebook that wanted to stop immigration to Sweden. The perpetrator had no criminal record and was not a member of any political organisation, but had supported a petition by the Sweden Democrats to initiate a referendum on immigration. He left a handwritten note at his home in which he declared that something had to be done about immigration, and that he did not expect to survive his attack.";;;

A few hours before the attack, the perpetrator posted under a girl's name "" “Come today at four o’clock to McDonald’s at OEZ [shopping centre]. I am giving away anything you want as long as it’s not too expensive.” Four pepole were shot and killed inside McDonalds, a fifth died outside. The perpetrator killed himself after the attack. The investigation into the case lasted three years. The crime was initially classified as a non-politically motivated rampage and believed to be related to the perpetrator having been bullied. In October 2019 it was deemed ""justified by a political motivation in the sense of the PMK definition system"". According to a friend, he “developed a huge hatred of most foreigners” because classmates with a migrant background “really picked him up” at school. Investigators later found that the victims were  similar to people who the perpetrator had felt bullied by. The perpetrator wrote a ""manifesto"" about ""foreign subhumans"", ""cockroaches"" and people he would ""execute.""";;;

The perpetrator boasted about the explosives on Snapchat and messages, which included a cartoon-like image of a mosque being blown up, were shared with police. The bomb was found in his bedroom desk. Counter-terrorism officers arrested the boy in his bedroom in July 2016 after a member of the public alerted them to a series of Snapchat posts. On the night of the killing of the British Labour MP (CaseID: 2016-6-16), the perpetrator posted a picture on Facebook a picture of the murderer along with this post: ‘[name] is a HERO. There’s one less race traitor in Britain thanks to this man.’ The perpetrator's teachers considered him “bright and articulate” and said he would always dress smartly, sometimes in a business suit. He did not socialise with other students and would often sit alone in class. In the months leading up to his arrest his attendance at college dropped off dramatically. In April, he was contacted by National Action. The perpetrator went on to join National Action, and webcam footage of his bedroom covered in flags bearing Nazi swastikas was shown in court. His racist ideology continued to grow during his membership of National Action and he took part in demonstrations. There were a number of social media posts and messages associated with the perpetrator, including footage of him at a National Action demonstration in York. Messages from members of a National Action chatgroup found on his phone included phrases like “should we just blow up Leeds or some shit?”. In early June, he wrote to a friend on Facebook Messenger: “The IRA is where we get most of our techniques from. We follow them religiously, the way they operated in an urban environment. The way they blended into the population. Urban guerrilla warfare is what we need to learn.” During his trial the boy admitted he had wanted people to think he was planning an attack, but said he never had any real intention of carrying one out. The 17-year old was sentenced to a three-year youth rehabilitation order. He was also ordered to receive intensive counselling from a deradicalisation expert;4;2;3

The ten activists were affiliated with a group called Organsation de l'Armée sociales (OAS), alluding to the acronym of the far-right terrorist Organsation de l'Armée Secrete (OAS) responsible for a bloody campaign against the independence of Algeria in the 1960s. The plots were premature and several targets were envisaged, including places of worship (in particular mosques), anti-fascist activists, black people of North African origin, or politicians. Two named national politicians, representing the left and a spokesperson for the government were among the potential targets. The plots were apparently detected as a result of government monitoring of online activities. The group leader administered a Facebook page glorifying Anders Behring Breivik with more than 3000 members, praised other far-right terrorists online, and wrote on his own network: “Rebeux, blacks, racailles, migrants, dealers, djihadistes. Toi aussi tu rêves de tous les tuer? Rejoins l'OAS!” In addition, he was regularly practicing shooting at a shooting range. According to Le Monde, his case first passed through the hands of the Directorate of Public Liberties and Legal Affairs (DLPAJ), at the Ministry of the Interior. On May 16, the DLPAJ sent this report to the national gendarmerie. The file was then entrusted, on June 8, to the terrorism investigation and prevention group of the Marseille research section and a preliminary investigation was opened locally. In October 2021, six members of the group were sentenced for forming a criminal terrorist association. The leader was sentenced to nine years in prison, whereas the second in command was sentenced to seven years. During the trial, the leader argued that they never had any concrete attack plans, but also admitted that he had founded an organization with terrorist aims, in particular “triggering remigration based on terror”, and while the operational planning was in “its initial phase”, it likely would have ""evolved"" had it not been stopped by the authorities. He also submitted a letter arguing that he had deradicalized in prison since his arrest, and that he no longer supports the actions he is being sentenced for. The trial also exposed internal manuals, written by the leader, which are full of details, specifying the ranks of the organization ( “commander”, “mission manager”, “autonomous member” …). They were also posters ( ""Hunters of Arabs!"" ), recruitment methods inspired by the secret services, and tips for not being infiltrated. During the trial, the leader admitted: “We knew we were going to do illegal things. We weren't going to shout it from the rooftops.""";4;5;3

A map showing the addresses of five Mosques in the Aberdeen area were discovered on his computer. They also found that he had started to compile a book called “Combat 18 British Mosque Address Book.” On the title page of the book, he had written : “This book is dedicated to all that follow Mohammed and the Islamic faith. You will all soon suffer your demise.” The perpetrator, a former psychiatric patient, claimed he was suffering from mental illness at the time and said he believed the world was going to end in 2012 and he wanted to survive the apocalypse. Jurors did not believe him and returned guilty verdicts on two charges of breaching the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Terrorism Act 2006 and must serve at least six years before he is eligible for parole. He had previously convicted for other crimes. The investigation was initiated after a tip-off that the perpetrator had broken strict firearms legislation by buying a stun gun from abroad.;2;6;2

He allegedly wanted to 'take revenge on those he blamed for his unhappy life' and regarded the Columbine shooters as 'legends.' The self-described 'loner' voiced his white supremacist beliefs and hatred for the people of Workington, who he blamed for school bullying and his inability to get a job, to a probation officer. He was being monitored after a 32-month sentence for barricading himself inside a flat and setting it on fire after a row with his brother about his racist views. He was referred to the government’s Prevent counter-extremism scheme nine months before he was arrested, after telling the officer he dreamed about 'shooting up a mosque.' He had been offered the opportunity to meet with former members of far-right groups, such as the EDL and Combat 18, but he said he did not want to. He described any such former members as being race traitors. The prosectur stated 'his hatred was borne of his racist belief that people who were Jewish and not white were responsible for his inability to find work and to make any kind of a meaningful life for himself.';2;3;2

When the victim got out of the bus, the officer ordered her to sit on the ground in the middle of a public road, which she refused. The officer then forced her to the ground, kicked her, sat on top of her, and choked her. She was also punched and subjected to racist insults. She was eventually hospitalized and diagnosed with severe traumatic brain injury. The incident again sparked a nation-wide debate regarding the relationship between police forces, brutality, and immigrant communities. The images and video surveillance evidence were destroyed by the police.;;;

The investigation began in 2020 after the police received an anonymous complaint through the citizen collaboration web portal about a far-right forum. One member of the network was known and followed up for previously attacking a LGBT+ headquarters building (the case was reviewed and excluded from this dataset due to the RTV severity threshold, as a flag hung on the building was burned) at the moment of the investigation. During the police intervention, seven members of the network were simultaneously arrested in Alcoi, Torrejon de Ardoz and Barcelona. The seized weapons included a revolver, three carbines, simulated firearms, ammunition, knives, baseball bats and explosives-making manuals, as well as lists of car registration plates owned by political opponents such as left-wing politicians and separatists. The seven detainees were, according to the police, a cohesive network through social media that incited hatred and extreme violence against antagonistic groups and proposed initiating armed violence in the streets. The weapons and arsenal of materials were found in Alcoi. They were charged with hate crimes and illicit association for planning violent acts of a political nature. Five of the intial seven suspects were finally sentenced for hate crimes and the formation of an illegal association. A concrete atatck plan was never discovered.;3;6;3

The police officer was thrown onto the hood of the moving car and then onto the road, and as a result, he suffered serious head injuries and is now unfit to work. In the evening of the attack, police officers were pursuing a white Mercedes, as the drunk driver already had avoided a police check and then parked in a forest area for about an hour. When the perpetrator wanted to take a detour back to his home, he was caught up with by the officers, who exited their police vehicle and ran towards the perpetrator. However, the situation escalated, and despite the police firing shots at the perpetrator, he turned his car around and hit one of the police officers. After the victim came to lie on his stomach on the bonnet, the perpetrator accelerated again, and steered his car to the side in such a way that the officer fell onto the street and suffered a brain hemorrhage. As part of the Reichbürger movement, the perpetrator denies the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany and does not recognize the sovereign powers of its political and civil representatives. A political motive and the deliberate targeting of the police officer is thus suspected. The trial is ongoing (last updated March 2023).;;;

One arrest was conducted in Austria and another one in Italy. The perpetrators were organized and aimed at carrying out a coup d'état, including storming the Reichstag, the German parliament building. Among the arrests there was a judge and former MP for the far-right party AfD, a prince from the House of Reuss and several members of the police/security services. The prince was the head of the central body of the organization, the Council, and he was supposed to become the new head of state after the coup was successful. The organization was divided in a civil branch, headed by the prince and the Council, and a military branch, headed by a former paratrooper. The members were well-organized, and met in small groups, divided the tasks to be carried out, communicated via a messaging app, and even signed an NDA upon entry. 93 weapons were seized, including 19 handguns and 25 rifles, knives, crossbows, decorative weapons, and blank pistols. The organization attempted (unsuccessfully) to gather support from Russia to carry out their plan.
